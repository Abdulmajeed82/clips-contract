//! Batch-mint-completed event — emitted once after every fully successful
//! batch mint operation.
//!
//! Resolves issue #697: emit a single `"btch_done"` event summarising the
//! outcome of a successful `execute_batch_mint` call so off-chain indexers,
//! wallets, and analytics pipelines can track batches without scanning every
//! individual `"mint"` event.
//!
//! # Event topic
//! `"btch_done"` — 9 characters, exactly at the [`soroban_sdk::symbol_short`]
//! limit.
//!
//! # Event data
//! [`BatchMintCompletedEvent`] — batch ID, number of NFTs minted, recipient
//! address, and ledger timestamp.

/// Emit the `"btch_done"` event after a fully successful batch mint.
///
/// Must be called **only** when the entire batch has been committed to storage
/// without error.  Receiving this event guarantees that all `minted_count`
/// tokens are queryable on-chain with the `recipient` address as owner.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env`          — Contract execution environment.
/// * `batch_id`     — Monotonically increasing identifier for this batch.
/// * `minted_count` — Number of NFTs created in this batch.
/// * `recipient`    — Address that received ownership of every minted token.
/// * `timestamp`    — Ledger timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch.
